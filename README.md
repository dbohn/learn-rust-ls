# Simple ls in Rust

I'm currently tinkering with rust. As a little project, I'm reimplementing some parts of ls, that I find interesting or that help me learning.

This should not be considered idiomatic code. I'm expanding this as I discover new concepts in the rust world,
which is a little bit different to what I'm used to.
Currently it is possible to list the contents of the current directory by passing no arguments or of a single given directory by passing a path.
